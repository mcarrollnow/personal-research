├─ Moderate: Primary Admin (High Priority Message)  
└─ Mild: Monitoring Status (No immediate action)
```

### **Progress Milestone Workflow**  
```
Patient Logs Data → Weight/Week Analysis →
├─ Milestone Reached → Celebration Message to Patient
└─ Admin Notification → "Patient Achievement Alert"
```
